### TypeScript Basics

At it's core TypeScript provides static typing that prevents a developer from breaking their application at runtime.

For example, if we have a function takes two parameters, `name` and `score`, one could derive that `name` would be a string value and `score` would be a number value. TypeScript allows the developer to enforce these types:

{% highlight javascript %}
function (name: string, score: number) {
	...
}
{% endhighlight %}

And if we don't fulfill that contract you'll see something like this in your editor:

Place your cursor on `name` and you'll see what is wrong:

### ES2015 Features

In addition to bringing static typing to JavaScript, TypeScript gives us tomorrow's features today. This means we can use Modules and Classes right now and TypeScript will compile them into ES5 friendly code that can run today's browsers.

Other new features include:

* Lambda functions: `() => {}`
* Default parameter values: `(name = 'ken'){}`
* Template strings
* [and more](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook)

### TypeScript Advanced

Some of TypeScript's advanced features will help bridge the gap for back end developers wanting some type safety in JavaScript. These include things like [interfaces](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#interfaces), [generics](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#generics), and [overloads](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#functions-overloads).

### Take What You Want

An important thing to remember when beginning with TypeScript is that it's 100% opt-in. You don't need do apply types to anything if you don't want to. TypeScript infers types where it can, otherwise it will set the type of `any` on your properties. This is very different from other typed languages.

Looking to get started writing your first bit of TypeScript? There are many [TypeScript resources](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) available in addition to a [playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground) where you can take the language service for a test drive.
